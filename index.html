                    <p> First inhabitants of Istanbul are dating back to second millennia BC, 
                        they were settled on the Asian side of the city.
                        Its first name comes from Megara king Byzas who took his
                        colonists here in the 7th century BC to establish a colony named Byzantium, 
                        the Greek name for a city on the Bosphorus. Byzas chose this spot after 
                        consulting an oracle of Delphi who told him to settle across
                         from the "land of the blind".</p>

                    <p> In ancient times, many people were moving to Istanbul's forerunners, 
                        then known as Byzantion, later on as Constantinople or Byzantium. 
                        It has been the capital of three successive empires and seen an influx 
                        of all kinds of ethnic groups. They came as colonizers, settlers, traders, 
                        conquerors, or migrant minorities, but they all left their mark.
                        Today, Istanbul is not only the biggest city in Turkey. 
                        People moving here will experience a vibrant culture, a modern society, 
                        and a dynamic economy.</p>

                    <p> Istanbul is a charming city full of historical sites complete with warm, 
                        friendly locals. It is so rich in history, its former names -Byzantium and Constantinople- 
                         may take you back to history class. Tourism in Istanbul can likely owe its steady 
                         flow to the architectural masterpieces, including remnants of both these empires, 
                         that still stand tall in the heart of the city.</p>
